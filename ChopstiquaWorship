<h1>Hello!</h1>
<p>If you're here, that means you either cheated or legitimately obtained the link from my scratch account.<br>
so congrats to you for that. <br>
(It also means that I have some idea or knowledge to be able to create a somewhat hidden easter egg.) <br>
So congrats again.<br>
If you're bored after playing my tetris ripoff, maybe you should check out my youtube channel.<br>
which is here, by the way. <br>
